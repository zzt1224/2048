# Python 2048 AI Foundation

This project hosts a Python implementation of the 2048 game, serving as a foundation for AI and machine learning experiments. The game logic is encapsulated in classes, making it easy to integrate with various AI algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), neural networks, and other AI strategies.

## Introduction

2048 is a single-player puzzle game where the player combines numbered tiles on a grid to achieve the highest score possible. This Python implementation focuses on creating a backend for the game, providing a platform to develop and test AI algorithms.

## Features

- Core 2048 game logic implemented in Python.
- Classes and methods designed for easy integration with AI algorithms.
- No user interface â€“ this project is intended for AI development and testing.
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation.
